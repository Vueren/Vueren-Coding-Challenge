# Welcome to Vueren's Coding Challenge, Season 1!

For this Season, we are going to be doing file handling shenanigans.

**Your goal by the end of the season is to have a fully functioning module for your own use.**

Along the way, you may be asked to write a program using the modules you write.

There are no *specific* file system, OS, hardware, display, or even language requirements.

## The only requirement is:
1) Your language must support operations within the file system
2) Your file system environment (and, by extension, the language) must support listing, reading, creating, writing, deleting, and renaming files
3) Your OS supports reading from your chosen persistent storage option (disks/HDD/SSD/USB/etc)
4) Your display system of choice must allow user interaction

## Out of Scope/Optionally performed for cookie points:
1) Executing files
2) Opening an editor
3) Scheduling tasks
4) Cross-platform support
5) Cross-drive support
6) Setting permissions
